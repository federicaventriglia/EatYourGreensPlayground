 ## **Fruit Yo-Self**

I know what you might be thinking... _"But I like fruit already, my pizza had pineapple on it last night!"_. Well my friend, I don't wanna get into the pineapple on pizza business because I'm italian, so I'll just ignore that thought.
 
 Also, you still need your greens to keep your body healthy and that's definitely not the fair amount of fruit to eat.
