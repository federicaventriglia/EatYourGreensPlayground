/*:
 ## **Animate Yo-Fruit**
 
 Remember when our parents used to tell us not to play with our food? Well while they might have been right about actual food, I see nothing wrong with having a little fun with these little guys here, shall we?
 
 **Challenge**: Use the functions suggested like `createStrawberry()` , `moveStrawberry()` and `danceStrawberry()` to create and animate your character.

 Tap `Run My Code` to show the changes you make.

 **Hint**: You can't just say 'let's dance' to a strawberry that hasn't been created yet, it's like trying to run when we haven't even figured out how to walk!
 
 If you like, when you're done enjoy the *next chapter*!
